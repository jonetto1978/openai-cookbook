   - **Mixpanel MCP**: 20+ functions for product analytics  
   - **Intercom Export**: 456.9 MB of customer support data (722 files)

2. **CEO Assistant Foundation** 🏗️

### 🔄 **What Needs Integration**

The CEO assistant currently uses **mock data**. Your MCP tools provide **real data**. We need to connect them!

## 🚀 Integration Strategy

### **Phase 1: Replace Mock with Real Data (Week 1)**

**Current State**: 
```python
# Mock data in ceo_assistant_starter.py
def get_customer_metrics(self) -> Dict:
    return {
        "new_customers_this_month": 25,  # ← Mock data
        "churn_rate": 0.05,              # ← Mock data
        "customer_lifetime_value": 2400   # ← Mock data
    }
```

**Enhanced State**:
```python
# Real data using your MCP tools
def get_customer_metrics(self) -> Dict:
    # Call your actual MCP HubSpot tool
    contacts = mcp_hubspot_hubspot_list_objects(objectType="contacts")
    deals = mcp_hubspot_hubspot_list_objects(objectType="deals")
    
    return {
        "total_contacts": len(contacts.get("results", [])),
        "active_deals": len(deals.get("results", [])),
        "pipeline_value": calculate_pipeline_value(deals)
    }
```

### **Phase 2: Add Advanced Analytics (Week 2)**

**Mixpanel Integration**:
```python
# Get real user behavior data
top_events = mcp_mixpanel_get_top_events(limit=10)
retention = mcp_mixpanel_query_retention_report(
    from_date="2024-11-01",
    to_date="2024-11-30",
    born_event="User Signup"
)
funnel = mcp_mixpanel_query_funnel_report(funnel_id="your_funnel_id")
```

**Intercom Integration**:
```python
# Load your actual support data
conversations_df = pd.read_csv("/Users/virulana/Downloads/intercom-export/conversations.csv")
avg_resolution = conversations_df["resolution_time"].mean()
satisfaction = conversations_df["rating"].mean()
```

### **Phase 3: Advanced Insights (Week 3)**

**Strategic Insights**:
- Real conversion funnel analysis
- Actual customer churn patterns  
- Product usage trends from Mixpanel
- Support efficiency from Intercom

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Implementation

### **Step 1: Explore Your Data**

Run the data explorer:
```bash
python explore_intercom_data.py
```

This will show you:
- What files you have in your Intercom export
- Data structure and columns
- Sample data preview
- Recommendations for integration

### **Step 2: Test MCP Connections**

Test your MCP tools:
```python
# Test HubSpot connection
user_details = mcp_hubspot_hubspot_get_user_details(random_string="test")
print("HubSpot connected:", user_details)

# Test Mixpanel connection  
top_events = mcp_mixpanel_get_top_events(limit=5)
print("Mixpanel events:", top_events)
```

### **Step 3: Replace Mock Connectors**

Update `ceo_assistant_enhanced.py`:
1. Replace `MCPDataConnector` with `RealMCPConnector`
2. Update method calls to use your actual MCP functions
3. Map your specific events and properties

### **Step 4: Customize for Colppy**

**HubSpot Customization**:
```python
# Your specific deal stages
deal_stages = ["trial", "demo_scheduled", "proposal", "negotiation", "closed_won"]

# Your custom properties
custom_properties = ["company_size", "industry", "accountant_partner", "plan_type"]
```

**Mixpanel Customization**:
```python
# Your key events (replace with actual events)
key_events = [
    "Invoice Created",
    "Payment Processed", 
    "Report Generated",
    "User Login",
    "Trial Started"
]

# Your conversion funnel
funnel_steps = [
    "Trial Signup",
    "First Invoice Created", 
    "Payment Method Added",
    "Subscription Activated"
]
```
